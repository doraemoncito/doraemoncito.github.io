## Naïve Bayes Classifier

A Java implementation of a multi-class Naïve Bayesian classifier for the classification of newsgroup messages. This implementation can be used to detect spam by restricting it to two classes.  A description of the algorithm can be found in the [Machine Learning book](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mitchell/ftp/mlbook.html) by [Tom Mitchell](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/) (Published by McGraw-Hill. ISBN: 0071154671).

The source code and sample data are availble for download from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/doraemoncito/naivebayes).

## iFetcher: the visual iPlayer downloader

iFetcher is a small application written in C++/[Qt](https://www.qt.io/) that allows you to download unencrypted [BBC iPlayer](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer) TV programmes to your local hard disk for later viewing.  This utility is particularly useful if your broadband connection is too slow to support video streaming. Downloaded TV programmes can be transferred to an [iPod](https://www.apple.com/ipod-touch/) or [iPhone](https://www.apple.com/iphone/) using [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/).

Cross-platform source code and a 64 bit Microsoft Windows 7 binary are available from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/doraemoncito/ifetcher).
