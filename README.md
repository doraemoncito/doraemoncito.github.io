## [Boltzmann Fluid Simulations for HPC](https://github.com/doraemoncito/boltzmann)

This project contains a number of implementations in C/C++ of a Boltzmann fluid simulation optimised for different environments / platforms in addition to the original serial implementation of the [d2q9-bgk lattice Boltzmann scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_Boltzmann_methods).

The source code is available for download from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/doraemoncito/boltzmann).

## [Naïve Bayes Classifier](https://doraemoncito.github.io/naivebayes/)

A Java implementation of a multi-class [Naïve Bayes classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier) for the classification of newsgroup messages. This implementation can be used to detect spam by restricting it to two classes.  A description of the algorithm can be found in the [Machine Learning book](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mitchell/ftp/mlbook.html) by [Tom Mitchell](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/) (Published by McGraw-Hill. ISBN: 0071154671).

The source code and sample data are available for download from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/doraemoncito/naivebayes).

## [Noughts & Crosses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)

Java implementation of a reinforcement learning agent that plays [noughts and crosses (tic-tac-toe)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).

The source code is available for download from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/doraemoncito/noughts-and-crosses).

## [iFetcher: the visual iPlayer downloader](https://github.com/doraemoncito/ifetcher)

iFetcher is a small application written in C++/[Qt](https://www.qt.io/) that allows you to download unencrypted [BBC iPlayer](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer) TV programmes to your local hard disk for later viewing.  This utility is particularly useful if your broadband connection is too slow to support video streaming. Downloaded TV programmes can be transferred to an [iPod](https://www.apple.com/ipod-touch/) or [iPhone](https://www.apple.com/iphone/) using [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/).

Cross-platform source code and a 64 bit Microsoft Windows 7 binary are available from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/doraemoncito/ifetcher).

## [Equation Editor](https://github.com/doraemoncito/equation-editor)

A small Single Page Application that implements an Equation Editor written in Angular using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org).  The compiled Angular SPA can be deployed to GitHub pages and runs fully in the browser so no backend server is needed.

The GitHub Pages deployment of the equation editor can be found [here](https://doraemoncito.github.io/equation-editor/).
